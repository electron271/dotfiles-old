# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles, designed to be adaptable and simple!

## Installation
```bash
# Recommended method, will install to ~/.dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/electron271/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
# You can also use this to pick a specific directory
git clone https://github.com/electron271/dotfiles.git <directory>

# Run the install script
./install.sh
```
> **NOTE:**
> You can also run `git clone https://github.com/electron271/dotfiles.git` to just clone it to `dotfiles`
